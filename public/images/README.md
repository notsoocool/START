# Hero section images

Add your hero accent images here for light and dark mode:

- **Light mode:** `hero-light.png` → used at `/images/hero-light.png`
- **Dark mode:** `hero-dark.png` → used at `/images/hero-dark.png`

These images appear in the bottom-right of the home page hero section. If not present, a CSS gradient fallback is shown.
